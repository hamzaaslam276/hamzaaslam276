### 4. ETL Project: Acquiring and Processing Information on the World's Largest Banks

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **Cloud Data Engineering Roadmap** and focuses on building an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** to acquire, process, and analyze information on the world's largest banks. The project covers the full ETL workflow, from extracting raw data, transforming it, and loading it into a database, along with logging and query functions.

## Project Tasks

* Task 1: Logging function
* Task 2 : Extraction of data
* Task 3 : Transformation of data
* Task 4: Loading to CSV
* Task 5: Loading to Database
* Task 6: Function to Run queries on Database
* Task 7: Verify log entries
